    "# Introduction to your AI PC with Style Transfer and OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is adapted from the OpenVINO notebook Style Transfer with [OpenVINO™](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/tree/latest/notebooks/style-transfer-webcam)\n",
    "\n",
    "This module's goal is to just introduce you to the benefits of being able to run AI locally on your laptop. This is a demo that uses your webcam by default (or you can load in a downloaded video) and applies various artistic style filters in real-time. You can hot-swap filters and inference devices on the fly - the demo code compiles all the filter models to all the available devices when it starts up.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook uses five pre-trained models, for the following styles: Mosaic, Rain Princess, Candy, Udnie and Pointilism. The models are from [ONNX Model Repository](https://github.com/onnx/models) and are based on the research paper [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) along with [Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running this on your own, not as part of a workshop, install packages using `requirements.txt` and run the `setup.py` script before using this notebook."
